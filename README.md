# Progetto-MAGA
Evaluation of maze algorithm for generation and evaluation of maze solving algorithm for not perfect weighted maze.

In the repository we provide some benchmark file that we use during the development of the project to evaluate the solving algorithms.

The algorithms used in this project are:

Generation:

- Recoursive Backtraking
- Growing Tree
- Primm's alhorithm

Solve:

- Backtraking
- Dijkstra
- A*
- Greedy
